# HORISEO

## Description 
Horiseo is a search engine optimization business with a need to refactor the codebase of their website to use semantic html. The result is a website that is accessible to all people. During the project I learnt how to use semantic tags, class names and id's. 
What makes my project stand out is that I used css media queries to style the page for mobile phones.
